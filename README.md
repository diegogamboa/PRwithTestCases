**For those who need a template PR with test cases in small projects. I've been working with Github's issues and the need to create a template was obvious (at least for me) :smile:. It should help the QA, with the test case(s) and it already contains some guidance on how to proceed. Fell free to submit a PR if you feel it can improve** :rocket: :rocket:

# TEST CASE(S)

## 1. CRISPY BACON :pig: :fire: :pig: :fire:
The recipe comes from [here](http://baconmethod.com/)

1. Line a pan with the bacon. You can use a glass baking pan, a steel or aluminum baking sheet, or even a cast iron pan. Check out the list of tools we like.
2. Put the pan into a cold, unheated oven. I use the middle rack. 
3. Set the oven to bake at 400°F (204°C).
4. Set the timer for 20 minutes. It may take a bit more or less time, depending on your oven. You can calibrate your oven for even better results.
5. Fill edittext #5 
6. Remove the pan from the oven. Place the bacon on a plate (or a plate lined with a paper towel if you’re grease averse).

### Expected Result
1. The most crispiest bacon EVER
